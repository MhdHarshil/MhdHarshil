##### **a. Safety**

- **Reduced Accidents:** Potential to significantly lower traffic accidents caused by human error (e.g., distracted driving, fatigue).
- **Enhanced Reaction Time:** AVs can react faster than humans to sudden changes in traffic conditions.

##### **b. Efficiency**

- **Optimized Traffic Flow:** AVs can communicate with each other to reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow.
- **Fuel Efficiency:** Improved driving patterns and reduced idling can lead to better fuel efficiency.

##### **c. Accessibility**

- **Mobility for All:** Provides greater mobility for those who cannot drive, including the elderly and disabled.

##### **d. Environmental Impact**

- **Reduced Emissions:** Potential for reduced emissions through optimized driving and integration with electric vehicle technology.
