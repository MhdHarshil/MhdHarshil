##### **a. Sensor Systems**

- **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):** Uses laser beams to create a 3D map of the vehicle’s surroundings. Crucial for accurate distance measurement and object detection.

- **Cameras:** Provide visual input for recognizing traffic signs, lights, pedestrians, and lane markings.

- **Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging):** Measures the speed and distance of objects, particularly useful in adverse weather conditions.

- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Used for close-range detection, such as parking assistance.

##### **b. Software and Algorithms**

- **Perception:** Algorithms process sensor data to identify and classify objects (vehicles, pedestrians, obstacles).

- **Localization:** Determines the vehicle’s precise location using GPS, maps, and sensor data.

- **Mapping:** High-definition maps provide detailed information about roadways, including lanes, signage, and intersections.

- **Control:** Software makes real-time driving decisions and controls the vehicle’s acceleration, braking, and steering.

##### **c. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

- **Machine Learning:** Algorithms improve over time by learning from vast amounts of driving data.

- **Deep Learning:** Used for complex tasks such as object recognition and decision-making based on sensor input.
