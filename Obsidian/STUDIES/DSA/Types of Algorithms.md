# Simple recursive algorithm

* A recursive algorithm calls itself to do part of its work
* The "call to itself" must be smaller problem then the one originally attempted.
* [[Recursion#What is Recursion??]]

# Divide and conquer algorithms

* Divide the problem into smaller sub problems of the same type and solve these sub-problems recursively
* Combine the solutions to the sub-problems into a solution to the original problem

Ex : Quick Sort and Merge Sort

# Dynamic Programming algorithms

* They work based on memoization
* To find the best solution

# Greedy Algorithm

* We take the best we can without worrying about future consequences
* We hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution

# Brute Force Algorithm

* It simply tries all possibilities until a satisfactory is found

# Randomized Algorithm

* Use a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision
